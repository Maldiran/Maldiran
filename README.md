# Hello there!

My name is Michał, and I’m passionate about everything related to IT and new technologies.

I own a small server running Debian 12, and so far, I’ve deployed many websites on it using Apache and Docker. These include a local AI chatbot, an [online file explorer](https://github.com/Maldiran/online-files), a local search engine powered by SearXNG, and more. I also run my own mail server, based on the classic Postfix + Dovecot setup.
I have strong skills in PHP, JavaScript, C, and Rust, but I’m also open to learning new programming languages as needed.

Currently, I’m employed as a PHP developer at Medicover.

The best way to reach me is via [email](mailto:maldiran@maldiran.com).
